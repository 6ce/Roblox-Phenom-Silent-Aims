# Usage

All are "X to shoot" (press X on your keyboard to shoot), you'll need either KRNL, Synapse, Or Script-Ware to execute these

It'll show when you're in range for a shot when your character gets a green highlight around them

# Other Info

For the "Normal Aimbot" & "BounceBot", they'll jump for you when you press X if you're not already in the air, with the TBot it'll automatically do the dunking animation, and for the NoJump, it'll just shoot when you press X.

# Disclaimer

The "BounceBot" & "TBot" do not work in playground, they can be edited to support but I will not help you do it.
