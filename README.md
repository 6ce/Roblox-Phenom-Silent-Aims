# All scripts are open source, therefore they're not malicious, don't go claiming they are because of other people skidding off me.

I am the owner of this script, anyone who claims to have created it is lying to you & should not be trusted.

# Usage

All are "X to shoot" (press X on your keyboard to shoot), you'll need either KRNL, Synapse, Or Script-Ware (Windows & Mac both likely supported) to execute these

It'll show when you're in range for a shot when your character gets a green highlight around them

I recommend going to the practice place to get a feel for each one & learn how to use it.

# Other Info

For the "Normal Aimbot" & "BounceBot", they'll jump for you when you press X if you're not already in the air, with the TBot it'll automatically do the dunking animation, and for the NoJump, it'll just shoot when you press X.

# Disclaimer

The "BounceBot" & "TBot" do not work in playground (the "TBot" can be edited to support but I will not help you do it). The "Normal Aimbot" &  "NoJumpBot" should both work though.

Also, all these aimbots are succeptible to the glitch where you cannot shoot unless you rejoin, this is due to the key system in phenom being shitty and getting messed up
